# Wigle-KML-Downloader
Downloads KML's for all of your Wigle runs. Drop your KML's into a Google Earth folder to map all of your discovered networks.

You will need a Wigle account and your 'Encoded for use API'.

I grabbed a beta version of chromedriver from https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/ and extracted it.

Put everything in one folder.

Edit the script to change the location of chromedriver and add your API.


Running the script will open a chrome window and gives you 60 seconds to login before continuing the script.
Login to Wigle

Scroll to bottom of your uploaded files and click the 'more results' a few times if your trying to download as many as possible.

The script will continue to download and close when finished.
